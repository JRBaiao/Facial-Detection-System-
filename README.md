#Facial Detection System

## Overview

This project is a basic **Facial Detection System** built using Python and the **OpenCV** library. The goal is to create a machine learning-based application that can detect and highlight human faces in real time using a webcam or image input.

It's a great entry point for anyone interested in **computer vision**, **machine learning**, or **AI-powered surveillance systems**.

## Features

- 🎯 Real-time face detection using webcam
- 🖼️ Face detection in static images
- 📦 Lightweight and easy to run locally
- 💡 Built using OpenCV's Haar Cascade Classifier

## Technologies Used

- Python 3
- OpenCV (`cv2`)
- Haar Cascades for face detection

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Facial-Detection-System.git
   cd Facial-Detection-System
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install opencv-python
   ```

3. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python face_detection.py
   ```

## Example

When the script runs, it accesses your webcam and automatically detects faces, drawing rectangles around them in real time.

📷 **Detected Faces Output:**
```
[ ] <-- Rectangle drawn around detected face in video frame
```

## Future Enhancements

- Add face recognition capabilities
- Improve detection accuracy with deep learning (e.g., DNN or MTCNN)
- Build a GUI for easier interaction
- Save face data for attendance or access control systems
